## Google compute engine 
  Is used for provisioning and managing cloud VM instances.

## Unmanaged instance groups 
  They are used when we would like to do most of the management ourselves, though they aren't really recommended and are designed for heterogenous clusters,  
  eg: migrating a particular cluster that is on premise and you'd like it to run exactly as it is on google cloud.  
  
## pre-emptible machines 
  They cost 70% less than regularly charged VM, no control over the shut down of VM, doesn't alter number of available VMs  

## Cloud run 
  It runs containers not VMs, supports autoscaling but requires restructuring application as docker image to implement it.
